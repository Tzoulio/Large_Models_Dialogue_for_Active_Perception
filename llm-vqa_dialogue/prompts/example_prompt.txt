You will first need to explore the scene, here are some tips: 
-Keep exploring (moving close, right, left, back) until you spot a danger or know enough about the scene.
-Use logical sense and knowledge of the real world to ask questions and filter the captions. 
-Focus on specific contextual questions not open ended ones.
-Generalize the information you got and come up with a description and safety measures in the end.
-Ignore captions that do not make logical or coherent sense in a sentence.
-Your output should look something like this example: "Move closer, "Is there a vehicle in the scene?"", "Move back, "Did the vehicle crash?"" etc..
-When you are ready to provide a description, generalize all the good captions, ignore the bad ones that dont make coherent or gramatical sense and output your final description.

Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can control the drone and save its position when its necessary. Let us assume a random scene:
vqa model: answer, caption, matching percentage
you: (If no new information or object are mentioned in the caption): "Exploratory question" or "Movement command, "Exploratory question"".
     (If a new object or improtant information is mentioned in the caption you didnt know about before): "Save position, "Exploratory question about the scene"".
